# Orientation-Aware Object Detection for Aerial Imagery Using YOLOv8

This project focuses on detecting rotated objects in aerial and satellite imagery using an enhanced YOLOv8-based object detection framework. The system is integrated with a Flask-based web interface to allow easy image upload and result visualization.

## Features
- Object detection in aerial imagery
- Orientation-aware detection (future extension)
- YOLOv8-based deep learning model
- Flask + HTML/CSS web interface
- Real-time inference and visualization

## Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Flask
- HTML & CSS
- OpenCV, NumPy

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies  
2. Run `python app.py`  
3. Open browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## Future Scope
- Integration of rotated bounding boxes
- Angle regression visualization
- Performance comparison
